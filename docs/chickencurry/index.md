## Instructions

1. Melt butter and oil in a pan

2. Dice the onion. Fry in the pan slowly (20 minutes) until golden brown.

3. Add chopped chilli and garlic cloves to the onions and cook for a few minutes.

4. Brown skinned chicken pieces in a separate pan.

5. Add cumin, turmeric and garam masala / madras powder to onions. Add the chopped peppers too. Cook for a few minutes.

6. Add chicken stock to the onion mix (the amount needed should eventually cover the onions and chicken pieces). Bring it to boil.

7. Add a squeeze of tomato puree, salt and pepper to taste. Add the chicken bits. Add a cinommon stick and bay leaf.

8. Cover with a lid and simmer for 30 minutes, stirring occasionally. Make sure it doesn't boil dry: it should thicken up.

9. When the meat is cooked, take it out and allow the sauce to continue thickening. Once that is done, pour over the chicken bits.

10. In a separate pan, heat up some oil and add seeds until they start popping / smoking (this doesn't take long).

11. Pour the seeds over the curry.

12. Serve with rice and chutney or minty yoghurt.
