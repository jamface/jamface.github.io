| 6        | eggs                            |
| 1        | habanero / scotch bonnet pepper |
| 3-4 tsp. | mayonnaise                      |
| 1 tsp.   | mustard                         |
| 1 small  | yellow onion                    |

|          | paprika (optional)              |
|          | worcestershire sauce (optional) |

## Instructions

1. Hard boil the eggs. Cook in boiling water for 10 minutes and afterwards rest them in a colander.

2. Finely dice the onion, pepper and garlic (or crush the garlic).

3. Add the onions to a pre-heated saucepan with some cooking oil (e.g. olive, coconut oil).

4. After around 3-4 minutes (when the onion is soft), add the garlic and pepper. Cook for another 3 minutes or so.

5. Peel the eggs under cold running water. Transfer to a chopping board.

6. Carefully remove the yolks and put them in a small mixing bowl. Add the mustard, mayonnaise and onion/pepper/garlic mix. Optionally add a dash of worcestershire sauce.

7. Mix with a fork or spoon until the mixture becomes a mash (not fully smooth, some texture is good).

8. Spoon or pipe the mixture back into the egg whites.

9. Garnish the eggs with a very small amount of paprika - be careful not to put too much on, as it can have a gritty texture. Use a fine seive and only about 1/8th of a teaspoon of paprika. Enjoy!
