## Instructions

1. Melt the butter in a large pan / skillet on a medium-to-high heat.

2. Crush the caraway / cumin seeds into a powder.

3. Add the onions and crushed powder to the pan and cook for 5 minutes, until the onions are soft.

4. Season the onions with salt.

5. Lay the bratwurst over the onions, add the beer to the pan and reduce to a low heat. Simmer for 30-40 minutes, turning the bratwurst every 10 minutes or so.

6. Remove the bratwurst and put under the grill for 2-4 minutes to brown the outside, or cook them in a separate pan.

7. Thicken the broth by adding some flour if needed.

8. Return the bratwurst to the broth and serve from the pan, or transfer the broth to a gravy boat :)
