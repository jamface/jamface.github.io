## Ingredients

Serves 2-3 people

| Amount  | Item                            |
| ------- | ------------------------------- |
| 600ml   | milk                            |
| 1 large | baguette (stale)                |
| 2       | eggs                            |
| 100g    | brown sugar + extra for coating |
| 2       | cinnamon sticks                 |
|         | cinnamon powder                 |
|         | sunflower oil                   |

## Instructions

1. Add the milk to a pan with the sugar and 2 cinammon sticks. Bring it to boil.

2. Slice the baguette diagonally, about 1.5 - 2cm thick.

3. Pour the hot milk into a lasagna / deep tray and submerge the bread slices. Leave them in for 15 minutes each side (30 mins in total).

4. After 30 minutes, in a small frying pan, add enough sunflower oil to cover 1/2 of the bread's thickness, so a layer about 1.5 - 2cm thick. Bring it to a medium-high heat.

5. Add 2 eggs to a small bowl & beat.

6. When the oil is hot, take the soaked bread slices and coat them in egg, one slice at a time. Then transfer to the hot oil. Fry for about 1-2 minutes each side, until lightly golden brown (take care not to burn them).

7. Once done, lightly coat in cinnamon powder and sugar and leave them on some paper to absorb excess oil. Allow to cool slightly and then enjoy!
